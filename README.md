# The Black Spatula Project

## Overview
Goal: Evaluate whether AI models (initially OpenAI's "o1" and possibly "o1-pro") can reliably identify factual, logical, and mathematical errors in published scientific papers. We'll measure how many errors are detected, their seriousness, and the false positive rate, as well as the effort required to verify the AI's findings.

## Background
Inspiration: The project is named after a recent high-profile paper on black plastic kitchen utensils that contained a simple but consequential math error. This mistake, which passed peer review, could likely have been flagged by an AI reviewer.
